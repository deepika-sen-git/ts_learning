📄 TypeScript Basics & Features Demo
This file is a hands-on exploration of key TypeScript features, especially for beginners transitioning from JavaScript. It includes examples and comments that demonstrate:

✅ Console output and debugging

🔠 Type annotations (number, string, any, readonly, etc.)

📚 Arrays and tuples

🎯 Enums and literal types

📦 Type aliases, unions, and intersections

🧠 Type narrowing with typeof

🧪 Optional and nullable types

🧰 Function parameters (with optional/default values)

🧾 Object type definitions

🛠️ Optional chaining (?.) and error-preventing patterns

This file is intended to practice and showcase TypeScript syntax, features, and type safety, and can be used as a reference or learning tool when building larger apps with TypeScript and frameworks like React or React Native.
